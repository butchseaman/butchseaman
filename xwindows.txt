
Start XMing
You should have a Start Menu item for XMing. Go ahead and start it. If you're using a firewall, it'll ask you if you want to unblock it. You don't need to.

Look for the "X" icon in your system tray. Hover the mouse over it: it should say something like "Xming server - 0:0". The last bit should be "0:0", but if it's not, pay attention to that and use it below.

PuTTY
I'm assuming you're currently using PuTTY. If not, there's some good documentation on the PuTTY website. It's also very easy to use, so you should be able to start using it without much trouble anyways.

First, open PuTTY. Then, put in your normal settings for connecting to the CS cluster: under host name, put "your-username@login.cs.caltech.edu".

Then, on the left, click on the Connection/SSH/X11 sub-panel. It'll have a few options. Check "Enable X11 Forwarding", and in the "X display location", put "localhost:0:0" in the box (unless you didn't have "0:0" in the section above: then use "localhost:x:y", where "x:y" is whatever you saw on the icon). Leave the radio button on "MIT-Magic-Cookie-1".

Now click back to the main "Session" panel on the left. Put a name (like "CS + XWindows") in the text box in the middle right below "Saved Sessions". Click the "Save" button. From now on, you can double click the connection in the list box when you want to connect to CS; you don't need to do these settings every time.

Press "Open" to start PuTTY. Put in your password or do whatever you do to authenticate. Now run the command "xeyes &". You should get a big pair of googly-eyes that follows the cursor around. It works!
