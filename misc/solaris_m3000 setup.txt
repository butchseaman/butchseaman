Retype new XSCF password:

Grant wseaman the following privileges, useradm, platadm, aplatop.

XSCF> setprivileges wseaman useradm platadm platop

Here is a list of all available privileges.

domainop@n
• Can refer to the status of any hardware mounted in a domain_n.

• Can refer to the information of all system boards mounted.

domainmgr@n
• Can power on, power off, and reboot a domain_n.
• Can refer to the status of any hardware mounted in a domain_n.
• Can refer to the status of any part of a domain_n.
• Can refer to the information of all system boards mounted.

platop
• Can refer to the status of any part of the entire server but cannot change it.

platadm
• Control of the entire system
• Can operate all hardware in the system.
• Can configure all XSCF settings except the useradm and auditadm privilege settings.
• Can add and delete hardware in a domain.

for that user are defined in LDAP.
• Setting a user’s privilege to none prevents the user’s privileges from being looked up in LDAP.

XSCF firmware has two networks for internal communication. The Domain to Service Processor Communications Protocol (DSCP) network provides an internal communication link between the Service Processor and the Solaris domains. The Inter-SCF Network (ISN) provides an internal communication link between the two Service Processors in a high-end server.

Configure DSCP with an IP address using the setdscp command.

XSCF> setdscp
DSCP network [0.0.0.0 ] > 10.1.1.0

DSCP netmask [255.0.0.0 ] > 255.255.255.0

XSCF address [10.1.1.1 ] >
Domain #00 address [10.1.1.2 ] >
Commit these changes to the database? [y|n] : y

Configure the XSCF interface with an IP address, this will be the adress you connect to via telnet to manage the console.

XSCF> setnetwork xscf#0-lan#0 -m 255.255.0.0. 162.10.10.11

Enable the XSCF interface you just configured with an IP address of 162.10.10.11

XSCF> setnetwork -c up lan#0

Confiure the default route

XSCF> setroute -c add -n 0.0.0.0 -g 162.10.10.1 xscf#0-lan#1
XSCF> showroute -a
Destination Gateway Netmask Flags Interface
1622.10.0.0 * 255.255.0.0 U xscf#0-lan#0

Configure the hostname.

XSCF> sethostname xscf#0 paris

Configure the domain name.

XSCF> sethostname -d parishilton.com

You must apply the network configurations with the applynetwork command.

XSCF> applynetwork
The following network settings will be applied:
xscf#0 hostname :paris
DNS domain name :parishilton.com

interface : xscf#0-lan#0
status :up
IP address :162.10.10.11
netmask :255.255.0.0
route :

interface : xscf#0-lan#1
status :down
IP address :
netmask :
route :

Continue? [y|n] :yes

Please reset the XSCF by rebootxscf to apply the network settings.
Please confirm that the settings have been applied by executing
showhostname, shownetwork, showroute and shownameserver after rebooting
the XSCF.

Now reboot XSCF for the configuration to take effect.

XSCF> rebootxscf

After the reboot check the network settings.

XSCF> shownetwork -a

Enable ssh, it will require a reboot.

XSCF> setssh -c enable
Continue? [y|n] :y
Please reset the XSCF by rebootxscf to apply the ssh settings.

Enable telnet. You probably do not need telnet if ssh is enabled.

XSCF> settelnet -c enable
XSCF> showtelnet
Telnet status: enabled

It is much easier to configure and manage XSCF via https as you do not have to remember all the commands. I will show you how to enable https by creating a Web Server Certificate by constructing the self CA.

First generate the web server private key. Remember the passphrase you will need it in the next step.

XSCF> sethttps -c genserverkey
Enter passphrase:
Verifying – Enter passphrase:

Create the self-signed web server certificate by speficying the DN.

XSCF> sethttps -c selfsign CA Ontario Toronto CupidPost Technology Center wseaman_lin@email.com
CA key and CA cert already exist. Do you still wish to update? [y|n] :y
Enter passphrase:
Verifying – Enter passphrase:

Now enable https.

XSCF> sethttps -c enable
Continue? [y|n] :y
Please reset the XSCF by rebootxscf to apply the https settings.

Reboot with the rebootxscf command,

XSCF> rebootxscf
The XSCF will be reset. Continue? [y|n] :y

After the reboot you can connect to the XSCF console by telnet, ssh or https.
